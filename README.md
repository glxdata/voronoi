# Project Voronoi Graphs

> Example plotting Voronoi graphs in R, including a colorblind friendly style
>
> In a Voronoi graph points are placed on a 2-dimensional plane. Each point is placed in its own region, a.k.a. a Voronoi cell. If we added any additional points inside a cell, they would be closest only to the cellâ€™s original corresponding point. Think of the points as as fire stations spread around a city. When there is a fire, than the fire station that is located in the cell where the fire occurs, is the nearest to the fire. So now you know which fire station should respond to the fire because it is the nearest station. If you need to find the nearest hospital, surgery, airport or supermarket, or want to find the best location for a new school, a Voronoi map could be a great help. Voronoi diagrams have applications in almost all areas of science and engineering with your own imagination being the only true boundary.
